== Description ==
Read metrics for Google Analytics similar to the ones you find on Medium.

This plugin makes it super easy to track how many reads your articles are having. 

Its technology is based on the popular "reads metric" from Medium.com.

Give it a try, open an article, read it, and see how it is shown in your Google Analytics. 

Go to Behavior > Site content > All pages, filter the results with this search: "read=true". 

If you try to cheat, you'll see that it won't work. You have to actually read it at normal speed!

To calculate the read ratio, divide the number of reads by the total pageviews of the page.

WARNING: The plugin tells you the truth about your read statistics. The truth is sometimes hard to handle!

Made with love by Boost.re's team


== Installation ==
Upload the .zip to your server and enable the plugin. 

Once you have had some traffic, go to your Google Analytics. 

In Behavior > Site content > All pages, filter the results with this search: "read=true". 

You'll see the URLs of the articles that have been read and their statistics.

That is all!
